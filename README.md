# Fend Interpreter
Fend is my hobby-project object oriented programming language. The Fend Interpreter is an implementation of Fend as a Tree-Walk interpreter written in C#.

## Instructions
The Fend Interpreter can be ran either as a repl, by calling the program passing no arguments, or with a path to a single file of type fend. The fendplayground folder provides a very brief example of some fend code to be used or imitated. The Fend Interpreter also provides an abstract syntax tree generator, although it does not have support for some of the more advanced features of fend.
